        <h2>Macronutrients and Micronutrient</h2>
        <p><em>Macronutrients</em> are nutrients that the body needs in large amounts because they provide energy and are essential for growth, metabolism, and other bodily functions. The three primary types of macronutrients are carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Water is also often considered a macronutrient because it's essential for life, although it doesn't provide energy. <em>Micronutrients</em> are nutrients that the body needs in smaller amounts, but they are just as essential for maintaining good health and proper functioning. They do not provide energy directly, but they play crucial roles in metabolic processes, immune function, and cell and tissue repair. Micronutrients include vitamins and minerals. </p>

        <h2>Factors of Macro</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Carbohydrates</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Carbohydrates are the body's primary energy source. When you eat carbs, your body breaks them down into glucose (sugar), which is used by cells for energy.</li>
                    
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Proteins</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Proteins are vital for building and repairing tissues, including muscles, skin, and organs. They are also involved in producing enzymes, hormones, and other body chemicals. Proteins are made up of amino acids, and there are 20 different amino acids, nine of which are essential (meaning they must come from food).</li>
                    
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Fats</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fats are a concentrated source of energy and are necessary for absorbing fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), maintaining cell membranes, and supporting the production of hormones.</li>
                    
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Water</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>While water doesnâ€™t provide energy, it's considered a macronutrient because the body needs large amounts of it. Water regulates body temperature, aids digestion, transports nutrients, removes waste, and is involved in nearly every bodily function.</li>
                   
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Factors of Micro</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vitamins</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vitamins are organic compounds that help the body perform specific biochemical processes. They are involved in energy production, immune support, bone health, blood clotting, and skin health, among other functions.</li>
                    
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Minerals</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Minerals are inorganic substances that help with a range of bodily functions, from maintaining strong bones to transmitting nerve impulses. Minerals are also involved in enzyme reactions and muscle contractions.</li>
